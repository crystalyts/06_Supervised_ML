# 06_Supervised_ML

Consider a real estate company that has a dataset containing the prices of properties. It wishes to use the data to optimise the sale prices of the properties based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc.Essentially, the company wants â€”
- To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g. area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.
- To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables such as number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.
- To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict house prices.

This project utilizes the dataset from Kaggle containing a historical register of housing prices in Ames, a small city in Iowa. The project involves practicing feature engineering, implementing Random Forest, and performing Hyperparameter Optimization to improve the model's performance.

### Steps to follow in this project

1. Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Building
5. Model Deployment

## Result 
Creation of a small web-app on Streamlit
